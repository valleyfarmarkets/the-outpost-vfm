      "question": "How far are the cabins from San Diego?",
      "answer": "The Outpost VFM is located in Mount Laguna, approximately 50 miles east of downtown San Diego. The scenic drive takes about 1 hour via Interstate 8 and Sunrise Highway. You'll climb from sea level to 6,000 feet elevation, passing through diverse landscapes from desert to pine forest. It's close enough for a quick weekend escape, yet feels worlds away from the city.",
